Despia is a deployment platform that converts web applications into fully native mobile applications for the App Store and Google Play.

Architecture: Despia provides a complete native application framework with extensive native features and modules. The platform uses webview technology for UI rendering, providing unlimited design flexibility and access to the npm ecosystem, while despia() functions execute native Swift/Kotlin code through a lightweight JavaScript bridge.

Platform Compatibility: Compatible with all major web development tools including AI builders (Lovable, Bolt, v0), JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Angular), no-code platforms (WeWeb, Nordcraft), and vanilla JavaScript.

Core Advantages:

    Over-the-air updates enable instant deployment without app store review

    Full compliance with App Store and Play Store requirements

    Complete source code export for Xcode and Android Studio

    Access to advanced native features typically requiring weeks of custom development

Installation

Integrated Platform Support: For platforms with built-in Despia integration, native features can be requested directly through your development environment.

AI Builder Integration: For AI builders without native support, provide the following instruction: "Install despia-native and implement according to the documentation at [this page link]"

Standard Installation:

npm install despia-native

import despia from 'despia-native';

This package provides access to over 25 native device features.

Standard Features:

// Haptic Feedback
despia('lighthaptic://');
despia('successhaptic://');
despia('errorhaptic://');

// Application Information
const appInfo = await despia('getappversion://', ['versionNumber', 'bundleNumber']);
const deviceId = await despia('get-uuid://', ['uuid']);

// UI Controls
despia('spinneron://');
despia('hidebars://on');
despia('statusbarcolor://{255, 255, 255}');

Advanced Feature Implementation:

Safe Area Integration:

Automatic CSS variables for device-specific layouts:

.my-element {
  padding-top: var(--safe-area-top);
  padding-bottom: var(--safe-area-bottom);
}

Implementation Guidelines

1. Application Development

Develop your web application using any preferred framework or platform (AI builders, React, Vue, vanilla JavaScript, etc.)

2. Native Feature Integration:

import despia from 'despia-native';

despia('successhaptic://');  // Haptic feedback implementation
const info = await despia('getappversion://', ['versionNumber']);  // Application version retrieval

3. Environment Detection:

if (navigator.userAgent.includes('despia')) {
  despia('lighthaptic://');  // Native application context
}

4. Deployment Process:

    Web: Deploy to standard hosting infrastructure

    Mobile: Provide web application URL through Despia dashboard

    Updates: Automatic distribution via over-the-air system
