"I need you to execute the following refactor for SellPage.tsx and the associated backend routes. This is a high-priority task to fix data persistence and performance. Follow this execution order strictly:

Phase 1: Database & Model Alignment

    Check Schema: Open shared/schema.ts. Identify the exact names/types for shippingType, shippingCost, area, and sku.

    Clean SellPage: Remove all code related to watchSpecs (state, UI, and auto-fill logic).

    Update State: Ensure the formData object in SellPage.tsx includes area, sku, and shippingCost as keys.

Phase 2: Data Mapping Logic (The 'Edit' Fix)

    Refactor Loading: In the useEffect that loads sourceListing, map every field from the database to the form state.

        Crucial: Use sourceListing.field ?? default to handle nulls correctly.

        Dates: Convert database ISO strings into YYYY-MM-DD for the date input and HH:00 for the hour select.

    Refactor Submission: In handleSubmit, explicitly convert strings to numbers: price: parseInt(formData.price) || 0, shippingCost: parseInt(formData.shippingCost) || 0. Ensure area and sku are included in the final payload.

Phase 3: Backend & API (The 'Persistence' Fix)

    Hardened PATCH Route: In routes.ts, update the PATCH handler. Ensure it only updates fields sent in the request (Partial Update) and verify that it correctly handles the transition of date strings back into Date objects.

Phase 4: Performance & UX Optimization

    Parallel Image Uploads: Refactor handleImageUpload using Promise.all so multiple images upload simultaneously.

    Debounced Drafts: Wrap the localStorage save logic in a 1000ms debounce to prevent 'jank' while typing.

    Component Splitting: Extract the Image Section, Pricing Section, and Shipping Section into separate functional components within SellPage.tsx to prevent full-page re-renders on every keystroke.

Phase 5: Validation & Testing

    Verify that a listing created with 'Buyer Pays Shipping' correctly displays and saves the cost.

    Verify that editing a listing doesn't reset the shippingType to the default value."
