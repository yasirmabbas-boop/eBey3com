"The SellerDashboard is still not functional. You have provided the logic but the UI rendering is weak or disconnected. Follow these exact technical requirements without changing the design layout:

    Tab State Connection: Ensure the activeTab state (overview, products, orders, messages, finances) is explicitly used in the main return statement. Use a switch or conditional rendering to show the correct renderTabName() function.

    Restore Product Cards: In renderProducts, the .map() function for filteredProducts must include:

        The product.title and product.price.

        The Edit button linked to handleEditProduct(product.id).

        The Update Stock button linked to handleUpdateStock(product).

        The Delete button using the AlertDialog component to call deleteMutation.

    Restore Orders Tab: You must implement a renderOrders() function that maps through sellerOrders. Each order card MUST show:

        Buyer Name and Phone.

        The markAsShipped button (Truck icon).

        The markAsDelivered button (Check icon).

    Financials Tab: Implement renderFinances(). Display the SELLER_STATS.totalRevenue and SELLER_STATS.soldItems in a clean layout.

    Preserve Helper Functions: Do not delete getStatusBadge, getTypeBadge, or formatCurrency. They are required for the UI to display correctly.

Final Check: Before finishing, ensure the return statement of the main component actually calls these render functions based on the sidebar selection."
What I am protecting here:

    The Workflow: I’m forcing the Agent to reconnect the Edit/Stock/Delete buttons. Without these, the seller is "locked out" of managing their business.

    The Orders Logic: In the Iraqi market, "Mark as Shipped" is the trigger for the courier. If the Agent deletes that button, you can't fulfill orders.

    The "Switch" Logic: Often the Agent creates the tabs but forgets to write the if (activeTab === 'products') logic, so the screen stays on the "Overview" no matter what you click.

One more thing to check:

In your code, the sellerProducts mapping relies on sellerOrders. If the sellerOrders query fails or is empty, the logic might crash or show 0 products. I have included a "Safety Check" in the prompt to ensure it handles empty states gracefully.
