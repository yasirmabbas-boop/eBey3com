# Deployment: Google Cloud Only

**We no longer work on Replit. The project is deployed entirely on Google Cloud services.**

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Google Cloud Run (`ebey3-backend`) in `us-central1`
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting (rewrites to Cloud Run)
- **Database**: Cloud SQL (`ebey3-main-db` in us-central1)
- **Build**: Cloud Build (`cloudbuild.yaml`)

## Deployment Flow

1. **Push to git** (main branch) triggers deployment
2. Cloud Build runs `cloudbuild.yaml`:
   - Builds from source (`--source=.`)
   - Deploys to Cloud Run
   - Connects to Cloud SQL instance
3. Firebase Hosting serves `dist/public` and rewrites API requests to Cloud Run

## Key Files

- `cloudbuild.yaml` - Cloud Build config (deploys ebey3-backend)
- `firebase.json` - Firebase Hosting config (rewrites → Cloud Run)
- `Dockerfile` - Used by Cloud Build for container image

## Publishing Changes

To publish changes to the live site: **push to git** on the main branch. No Replit deploy button or manual steps—Git push triggers the full pipeline.
